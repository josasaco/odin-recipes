    <h1>This is a homemade lasagna recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg">
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato 
    sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would 
    be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese 
    and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty 
    garlic bread.</p>
